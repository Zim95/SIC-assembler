SIC ASSEMBLER

DEVELOPER’S GUIDE


Introduction

SIC assembler is an assembler for the SIC(Simplified Instructional Computer) assembly language. The SIC machine is a hypothetical machine with most of the fundamental architecture and organization of any real machine accomodated. The SIC has two different versions of itself too. The two versions are:
	i) SIC(Simplified Instructional Computer)
	ii) SIC/XE(Simplified Instructional Computer/Extended)

This particular assembler is only designed for the first one which is the basic version. The assembler for SIC/XE will be developed soon.
